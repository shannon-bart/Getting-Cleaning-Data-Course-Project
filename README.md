# Getting-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Course project for Getting and Cleaning Data

This is the README file for the Coursera and Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization, Getting and Cleaning Data course project

For this project, we are instructed to clean and prepare for analysis the dataset on Human Activity Recognition, found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

The files included in this repository are:
 - `run_analysis.R` the R script that performs the step by step instructions to prepare the dataset
 - `codebook.Rmd` a codebook that details the data used, the methods I chose to prepare the data and why, and the variables and their units
 - `final_data.txt` the final output, as a text file, after completing the steps described in the assignment
